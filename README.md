## Project Overview
This project is a data-driven exploration of the discography of Deftones, one of the most influential alternative metal bands of the last three decades. Using Power BI, I created a dashboard that visualizes key aspects of their musical journey, including lyrical themes, album popularity, critical reception, and fan engagement.
The goal was to transform raw musical data into meaningful insights through interactive visualizations. By combining structured data with artistic interpretation, this dashboard offers a unique perspective on how Deftones evolved sonically and culturally over time.
This project also marks a milestone in my professional transition from finance and controlling roles into the field of Data Analytics, with a focus on creative industries like music. It showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply DAX logic, and design compelling visual narratives that connect data with emotion.

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this dashboard was manually curated and enriched using publicly available information from multiple sources, including:
- Wikipedia – for album release dates, track listings, and general discography structure.
- Genius.com – for lyrical content and thematic analysis.
- RateYourMusic and Metacritic – for user ratings and critical reception.
- Spotify API (manually extracted) – for track durations and popularity metrics.
- Personal annotations – based on fan experience and musical interpretation.

This multi-source approach allowed for a richer and more nuanced analysis of Deftones' discography, combining objective data with subjective insights to reflect the band's artistic evolution.

## Why This Project Matters
Music has always been more than just sound—it's emotion, identity, and atmosphere. As a lifelong fan of Deftones, I wanted to explore how data can capture the essence of a band's evolution, impact, and artistic depth. This dashboard is not just a technical exercise; it's a tribute to the sonic landscapes that shaped my life.
By combining my growing skills in Power BI and data analytics with my passion for music, I created a project that bridges art and analysis. It reflects my transition from finance and controlling roles into the world of Data Science, with a focus on the music industry.
This project matters because it represents a personal and professional turning point. It shows how data can tell stories, evoke emotions, and even honor the legacy of a band that continues to inspire millions. It’s also the first step in building a portfolio that aligns with my dream: to apply data science in creative industries like music, where numbers meet soul.
